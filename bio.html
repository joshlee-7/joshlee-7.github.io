      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Josh Lee and I am a senior at Northwestern
        University studying computer science. I am naturally curious and love
        working with others to create and build solutions to complex problems.
        <br /><br />

        Previously, I have worked for a professor at Northwestern to develop a
        peer grading web application that is used by his students. Most
        recently, I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a
        software engineering intern for Summer 2022.<br /><br />

        I am always looking to expand my knowledge in the different fileds of
        computer science and am passionate about developing technology for the
        future!<br /><br />

        In my free time, I like to play basketball and practice playing my bass
        guitar. My favorite teams are the LA Lakers and Dodgers.
