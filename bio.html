      Hello there! My name is Josh Lee and I am a senior at Northwestern
      University studying computer science. I am a naturally curious person and
      love working with others to solve and create solutions to problems we
      face. Previously, I have worked for a professor at Northwestern to develop
      a peer grading web application that is used by his students. Most
      recently, I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a software
      engineering intern for Summer 2022.
