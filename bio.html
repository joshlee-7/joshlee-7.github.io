      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Josh Lee and I am a senior at Northwestern
        University studying computer science. I am naturally curious and love
        working with others to create and build solutions to complex problems.
        <br /><br />

        Previously, I have assisted Prof. Hartline at Northwestern to develop a
        peer grading web application that has been used by over 200 students.
        Most recently, I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a
        software engineering intern for Summer 2022 where I worked on internal
        tools projects.<br /><br />

        I am always looking to expand my knowledge in the different fields of
        computer science and am passionate about developing technology for the
        future!<br /><br />

        In my free time, I like to play basketball and practice playing my bass
        guitar. My favorite teams are the LA Lakers and Dodgers as well as the
        Northwestern Wildcats. Go Cats!
