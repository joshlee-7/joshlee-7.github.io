      Hello there! My name is Josh Lee and I am a senior at Northwestern
      University studying computer science. I am naturally curious and love
      working with others to create and build solutions to complex problems.
      <br /><br />

      Previously, I have worked for a professor at Northwestern to develop a
      peer grading web application that is used by his students. Most recently,
      I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a software
      engineering intern for Summer 2022.<br /><br />

      I am always looking to expand my knowledge in the different fileds of
      computer science and am passionate about developing technology for the
      future!
